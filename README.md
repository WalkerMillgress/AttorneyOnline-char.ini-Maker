# AttorneyOnline char.ini Maker
 For lazy people like me that prefer using a webpage instead of maybe trying, you know, copying some lines. Hope it's of some use to you!

 It should be available [here](https://walkermillgress.github.io/AttorneyOnline-char.ini-Maker/)!

 Done in HTML and plain Javascript. I may come back to this in the future and make it pretty, but for now, I hope it suffices!
